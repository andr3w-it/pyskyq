    This release adds much better EPG support through the addition of channel
    and programme data from www.xmltv.co.uk (or any other XMLTV source). With
    the addition of a number of new classes, it's now possible to load XMLTV
    into the ``EPG`` on demand, or via a schedule and have it integrate
    seamlessly with data obtained directly from the SkyQ box.
features:
  - Added the :class:`~pyskyq.xmltvlisting.XMLTVListing` class to download and
    parse XMLTV feeds.
  - Added cron-style scheduling of XMLTV downloads through the introduction of
    class:`~pyskyq.cronthread.CronThread`.
  - Generalised :class:`~pyskyq.channel.Channel` to support data from multiple sources
    and made some factory functions to generate Channels from various sources.
  - Added Channel merge function to enable a new channel to be created using
    merged data from both the XML TV and SkyQ sources.
  - Improved :meth:`pyskyq.EPG.getChannel` to enable more sophisticated searching,
    including by name, channel quality, ``+1`` channels using either fuzzy or
    exact matching.
issues:
  - More inversion of control is needed with the Status object to improve the
    interface and make it easier to test.
  - All asyncio-related loop and thread management stuff should probably be extracted
    into a separate class to be injected where needed.
fixes:
  - Massively improved test coverage for :class:`~pyskyq.epg.EPG` and made the
    tests more granular.
  - Made a better ``__repr__()`` for EPG, Channel and a few other classe to make
    debugging easier.
  - Fixed Sphinx layout, coroutine support, and ordering. Much improved module
    documentation also.
  - Made :class:`~pyskyq.channel.Channel` immutable and ``Hashable`` to facilitate
    easier management of lists of Channels.
  - Added :class:`pyskyq.constants.QUALITY` for representing the various channel
    quality types (``HD``, ``SD``, ``AU``).
