    This release adds much better EPG support through the addition of channel
    and programme data from www.xmltv.co.uk.
features:
  - Added the :class:`~pyskyq.listing.Listing` class to download and parse XMLTV feeds.
  - Generalised :class:`~pyskyq.channel.Channel` to support data from multiple sources
    and make some factory functions to generate Channels with various sources.

fixes:
  - Massively improved test coverage for :class:`~pyskyq.epg.EPG` and made the
    tests more granular.
  - Made a better ``__repr__()`` for EPG, Channel and a few other classe to make
    debugging easier.
  - Fixed Sphinx layout, coroutine support, and ordering. Much improved module
    documentation also.
