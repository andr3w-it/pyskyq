prelude: >
    The major change in this release is to move off ``asyncio` for a number of
    reasons and onto ``trio` as the preferred async library.
features:
  - Implemented :func:`pyskyq.status.getstatus()` async context manager for
    accessing the status of the SkyQ box.
issues:
  - |
    Had to monkeypatch the `h11` HTTP/1.1 Sans-IO library to force a specific
    case on the `Upgrade:` websocket header due to SkyQ not liking all lower-
    case headers that are the default from `h11`. See here_ for the details.

    .. _here: https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/issues/31
upgrade:
deprecations:
  - ``AsyncThread`` removed - not needed with ``Trio``.
  - Crontab support removed from EPG -- its better to be implemented outside the
    library or even just as a unix cronjob -- no sense re-inventing a perfectly
    good wheel.
  - Removed ``pyskyq.status.Status.standby`` and replaced it with
    :attr:`pyskyq.status.Status.online`.
fixes:
  - got rid of a lot of now superfluous ``asyncio`` related test packages.
  - fixed all relevant example scripts to use ``trio``.
other:
  - Got so p*ssed off with RTD not supporting Python 3.7 in their build process
    that in the end I followeed ``Quart``'s example and just serve the docs now
    via GitHub Pages.
