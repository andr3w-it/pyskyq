prelude: >
    The major change in this release is to move off ``asyncio` for a number of
    reasons and onto ``trio` as the preferred async library..

    this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text

    available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
    some details.

deprecations:
  - ``AsyncThread`` removed - not needed with ``Trio``.
  - Crontab support removed from EPG -- its better to be implemented outside the
    library or even just as a unix cronjob -- no sense re-inventing a perfectly
    good wheel.

other:
  - Got so p*ssed off with RTD not supporting Python 3.7 in their build process
    that in the end I followeed ``Quart``'s example and just serve the docs now
    via GitHub Pages.
