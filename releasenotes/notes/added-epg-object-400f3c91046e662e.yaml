prelude: >
    This ia quite a big bump, chiefly because it introduces use of :py:class:`asyncio` and
    other Python 3.7 features. The main addition is the introduction of the :class:`pyskyq.epg.EPG`
    class, which provides access to channel datails (name, number, HD/SD, description, etc).

    It **does not** (yet) provide the actual EPG programme data.
features:
  - |
    Added :class:`pyskyq.epg.EPG` support, specifically, the :attr:`~pyskyq.epg.EPG.channels
    attribute and data which closes issue 15_

    .. _15: https://gitlab.com/bradwood/pyskyq/issues/15
fixes:
  - sorted out GitLab CI jobs to run coverage and unit tests on master branch.
  - made badges work properly and be branch-aware
upgrade:
  - Upgraded minimum Python version to 3.7 due to the use of newer :py:class:`asyncio` features.
other:
  - tidied up some of the tests, including mocking the SkyQ Box REST API
  - fixed up all the tests that were breaking due to missing mocks on the REST API
  - changed the call signature for :meth:`pyskyq.SkyQ.__init__` to force use of keyword arguments
    for optional parameters.
