""" This module implements the Status class.

It implements an :py:mod:`asyncio`-based event loop in a separate thread. It will then
schedule subscriptions/polling tasks that subscribe to various events in async
co-routines/tasks and add them to the event loop. Each of these will:

* await an event (e.g. on a websocket or uPNP subscription) and then invoke a callback
  before resuming awaiting.
* potentially asyncio.sleep() before resuming... (is this needed? ðŸ¤”)
* each callback should update the appropriate attribute on the class and log the event.
